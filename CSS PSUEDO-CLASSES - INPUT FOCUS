   <p> The <b>:focus</b> CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. </p>
   <p> It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's "tab" key. </p>
   
   <h3> Example: </h3>
   <form action="#">
      <input type="text" class="blue-input" value="I will turn blue when focused" />
      <input type="text" class="green-input" value="I will turn green when focused" />
   </form>
